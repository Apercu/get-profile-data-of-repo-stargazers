# Get GitHub Profile Data of All GitHub Repo Stargazers
This repository contains a script used to get the GitHub profile information of all the people who've Stared a given GitHub repository. The time the user starred the repository is included as well. The combination of both of these metrics can be useful for quantifying popularity of a GitHub repository.

## Usage

To use the script, fill in the `access_token` with a Personal Access token obtained from the Settings panel on GitHub (never share with anyone else!). Additionally, set the desired repo name, in the form of `<username>/<repo_name>`.
